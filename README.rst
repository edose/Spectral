*Eric Dose, Bois d'Arc Observatory, Kansas  ::  June 2014*

This repository supports my June 14, 2014 presentation *Toward Millimagnitude Photometric Calibration* before the SAS (Society for Astronomical Science) 2014 conference in Ontario, California, USA.

Contents
--------
This repository provides:

- code (in C#, file extension .cs) for multiplying photon flux spectra and then producing for each combination of light source, atmospheric conditions, airmass, telescope, filter, and detector: (1) a computed Instrumental Magnitude, and (2) an expected exo-atmospheric magnitude within a bandpass. [directory "CS"]
- code (in R, file extension .R) for comparing the Instrumental Magnitudes and bandpass magnitude, using a specific model formula. This is the calibration phase, and the intent is to simulate the extraction of photometric values for: Zero-point, extinction, and system transform. [directory "R"]
- a few input and output data files as examples [directory "Data"]
- the slides shown during the June 2014 presentation [file: SAS Presentation 2014.pdf]

The accompanying paper will be published in the *Proceedings for the 33rd Annual Conference of the Society for Astronomical Sciences*, probably available August 2014 via http://www.socastrosci.org/publications.html .

The rest of this document amounts to comments on:

- this body of work itself,
- my thoughts on where high-precision amateur photometry may be going, and
- more modestly, my own next steps in these directions.
